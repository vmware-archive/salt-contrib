Salt Contrib
============

The Salt Contrib is a destination for modules developed by the community.
Since Salt modules are nearly infinite in application not all of the modules
developed will be shipped with the main salt application. Salt Contrib will
hold modules that can be cleanly added to any of the modular componets of
Salt. This will also act as a gateway for new module development, generally
it will be asked that pull requests for new modules be made against the
salt-contrib git repo.
